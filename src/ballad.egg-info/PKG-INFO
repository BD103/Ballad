        Have you tried setting up [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), but something doesn't work? Maybe you're...
        
        - Trying to implement Github Actions but the commands don't register.
        - Testing on a computer that doesn't have Poetry installed.
        - Just wanting to test out a package without any of these crazy depedency managers.
        
        If so, then you're in the right place!
